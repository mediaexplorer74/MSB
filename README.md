I have not any Fitbit (Flex or similar). But... I'm interested in cool Fitbit "Cloud infrastructure"... ;)

## Idea 

I have Microsoft Band 2. MS Health "cloud service" damaged. 
My idea: synthez [MS]Band2 "front-end" with Fit[B]it "backend".

So, wouldn't it be cool to have the band's steps sync into the Fitbit service on MS Band? :)

If you want to try this out or rip parts of it out, just make sure you register with Fitbit 
as a developer and have your Client ID and Client Secret handy.
